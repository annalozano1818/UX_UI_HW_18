            Project Linus is a non profit Organization that helps little
            Children in need. I really enjoyed working on this redesign 
            because it is something really personal and something that 
            Should be taken seriously. During this project
            we were unfortunately unable To speak with a steak holder 
            due to the covid-19 Pandemic.

            Pill wizard is a friendly for all types, medicine 
             reminder app. The problem we set out 
             To fix was that people were 
              Forgetting when and how to take their 
             medications. We started by doing user surveys, 
              interviews, and took it step by step we ended 
              Up solving our problem.
